% function [Scores,efd] = SCOmaker(KWIKfile,TrialSets)
% This SCOmaker function will give you information for all odor-cell pairs
% about how the odor reponse differs from the blank response. The output
% will be a structure called Scores. These can be further summarized to
% characterize unit responses per experiment. It will also pass along the
% full experiment data (efd) gathered from EFDmaker.
%
% If your experiment contains multiple conditions divided up into sets of
% trials (like awake or anesthetized or laser on and laser off etc..) you
% can indicate that with something like TrialSets{1} = 1:10; TrialSets{2} =
% 21:30; etc... If you don't put in any TrialSets all trials are analyzed
% at once.
%
% Scores output are stored like this:
% Scores.BlankRate and Scores.BlankSD - (Unit,BreathCycle,TrialSet)
% All other Scores - (Valve,Unit,BreathCycle,TrialSet)
% BreathCycle refers to which respiration cycle after odor delivery is
% analyzed. Usually you want to analyze BreathCycle 1 but you could
% potentially care about the evolution of a response past the first cycle.
%
% It's also important to note that scores are calculated on firing RATE not
% spike counts. That is, spike counts are divided by the length of the
% breath cycle.
